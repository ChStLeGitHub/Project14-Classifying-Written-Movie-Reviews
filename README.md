# Project 14: Machine Learning for Texts
 
**Objective:** To develop a model for the Film Junky Union, a community of classic movie enthusiasts, that is capable of classifying IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy.

**Accomplishment:** To pass this project, the final model must acquire an F1 value of at least 0.85. My final model, a logistic regression, acquired a value of 0.88 on the test set.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, text processing (text cleaning, lemmatization, and vectorization), and model evaluation
